            <p class="about-description">Hello!

I’m Sokpean, a sophomore at Williams who’s passionate about the intersection of computer science, sociology, and business. I’m interested in tech accessibility in education and disability. Furthermore, I’m passionate about exploring technology’s ability to do good in the world. 

I'm currently enhancing my practical skills as a Nonprofit Tech Talent Intern at Lean-Education Agile Foundry and serving as an Advising Fellow for high school students at Matriculate. My core competencies include software development skills with Python, Java, F#, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, complemented by proficiency in Figma, Rhino 3D, and Adobe Creative Suite.</p>

                        <p class="work-description">In a world of Reels and endless notifications, digital platforms rival in retaining our precious attention. Whether we’re entrapped in a doom-scroll or just have a busy schedule, many college students don’t have a chance to relax (nor know how to). And here comes Headspace to the rescue.</p>
                        <p class="work-description">Headspace is a mindful platform that helps you “feel like your best self with meditations, stress-relieving exercises, sleep resources, and beyond”. The company promotes itself as a powerful course to reduce stress and anxiety, but how effective is it? As a busy college student, I’m curious to explore the effectiveness of Headspace in reducing stress. In this design sprint, I will be interviewing end users of Headspace to learn more about their user experience as stressful college students.</p>

                        <p class="work-description">Our team was tasked with redesigning the Williams Global Education and Study Away website for a mobile phone format, with specific focus on tailoring the design for use by international students. The Williams Global Education and Study Away website provides individual study away program details as well as general information on advising, finances, and the application process. The current homepage of the Global Education and Study Away website features buttons that link to Program Options, Winter Study, WEPO, and Williams-Mystic. The major sections our team imagined would be most useful to display on the homepage would differ from these when considering our target audience. Our design was both informed by general design principles focused on maximizing clarity and ease of navigation as well as emphasizing elements that would be particularly useful or of interest to international users.</p>

                        <p class="work-description">Touch-free computer interactions have existed since the late 20th century. In their earliest form, voice command technologies could only recognize spoken numbers. Eye-tracking interfaces were similarly limited, allowing users to move the cursor with their eyes but offering little control beyond that. However, in 1985, Myron Krueger introduced the first gesture-controlled interaction, enabling users to manipulate computer graphics through body movements.</p>
                        <p class="work-description">In our design sprint, we explored Krueger’s innovation using modern technology. Our goal was to translate hand gesture inputs into keyboard control outputs. Essentially, we aimed to play our favorite childhood games using only hand gestures.</p>

Our development team, Sokpean & Friends, built the website with a strong emphasis on user functionality, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for all visitors.

We’ve all been there, 20 tabs open, chasing sources as you go down a rabbit hole of discovery. Keeping track of all our ideas, connections, and summaries can be difficult to organize as you search deepens, it’s easy to lose track of brilliant insights along the way. </p>           
                        <p class="work-description">EphWrite help you organize your thoughts as you navigate through various websites, saving your notes to each website as you search. Our serves to improve user experiences online during the researching and writing of a paper. We allow the user to endlessly cite any and all website they visit as well as write notes for website specific notes. This organization would remind the user of the importances of each of the webpages as they revisit the website. This would save and effort for the user once they revisit websites to write their paper. </p>
